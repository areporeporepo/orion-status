## The $100 Billion Picture

This single frame defends the entire Artemis program investment. One photo that makes every constituent say *"we should keep doing this"* — worth every dollar of the ~$93B spent through 2025.

*\*FY2026 in progress (Q2)*

### Artemis Program Cost

- **$93B** through 2025 (NASA OIG estimate)
- **~$4.1B per launch** (SLS + Orion operating cost, NASA OIG)
- **$7B** in cost overruns across three Artemis projects (GAO-25-107591)

### FY2026–2027 Budget Battle

| | Amount | Status |
|---|--------|--------|
| FY2026 enacted | **$24.4B** | Congress rejected White House cuts |
| FY2027 White House request | **$18.8B** | −23% cut proposed April 3, 2026 |
| FY2027 Senate authorization | **$25.3B** | Senate Commerce Committee (unanimous) |
| Artemis FY2027 request | **$8.5B** | +10% increase (exploration fully funded) |

The White House proposed cutting NASA 23% while increasing Artemis exploration by 10%. Congress has historically rejected these cuts. The Earth photos from Artemis are why — every constituent who sees them says *keep going*.

### Prediction Markets — Real-Time Swing Signal

> No active NASA FY2027 or Oct 2026 shutdown markets yet (too early — markets form ~2-4 weeks before deadlines). Monitor these endpoints for when they appear:

| Platform | API | What to Watch | Auth |
|----------|-----|---------------|------|
| **Polymarket** | `gamma-api.polymarket.com/events?_q=shutdown` | Shutdown probability, duration bets | None |
| **Polymarket WS** | `clob.polymarket.com` WebSocket | Real-time price moves during floor votes | None (read) |
| **Kalshi** | `api.elections.kalshi.com/trade-api/v2/events` | `KXGOVSHUT` series, debt ceiling, spending cuts | RSA key |

**Active Kalshi markets now**: "Will Trump balance the budget?" · "How much spending will Trump cut?" · "Peak US National Debt"

**Why prediction markets > polls**: Markets price in insider knowledge (staffers, lobbyists trade). When a shutdown market spikes from 30%→70% overnight, someone knows something. The Jan 2026 shutdown hit 94% on Kalshi days before it happened.

### Congressional Status

```
 RECESS         House out until Apr 13 · Senate in session
 NEXT HEARING   TBD — NASA Admin Isaacman expected before CJS subcommittees (Apr–May)
